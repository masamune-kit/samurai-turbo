Technology Risks.
No Warranties Etc.
Samurai Protocol and all other relevant technologies are being provided on an as-is basis, without
representation, warranty, insurance or indemnity, and that all participation is solely at your
own risk.
Irreversibility of Transactions and Lack of Remedies and Insurance for Damages.
Blockchain transactions are, under normal conditions, irreversible. Any tokens you deposit
into Samurai-related smart contracts are subject to potential risk of permanent disablement,
impairment, loss or forfeiture in the event of any exploits, bugs or malfunctions of the relevant
smart contracts or the underlying blockchain itself, and no remedy will be available from any
person due to any damages you may suffer in connection with your participation in the Samurai
smart contract system or use of any of the relevant technologies.
Experimental Technology; Technical Risks; Independent Due Diligence Required.
The technologies and assets involved in the Samurai smart contract system are highly
experimental and risky, have uncertain and potentially volatile value, and should be directly
evaluated by experts in blockchain technologies before use. Use them solely at your own risk.
You must not rely on any articles, summaries or published code audits as an accurate
description or evaluation of the Samurai smart contracts or any other blockchain, or
for purposes of making any financial or other decision. Instead, you must only participate in
the Samurai smart contract system after thoroughly reviewing and understanding the code of the
relevant smart contracts and the Samurai dApp in your own independent due diligence process.

Financial Risks
Risks of Token Deposits and Locking.
When you deposit any tokens into the staking / noding functionality on the Samurai dApp or into
Samurai-related smart contracts you are committing such tokens to the sole and
absolute control of the applicable software systems until such time as you withdraw such
tokens from such smart contracts. Staking, and certain other staking or deposit
mechanisms, may not allow for immediate withdrawal of tokens. If a lockup period or other limit on withdrawals applies, you will not be able to withdraw tokens
until the applicable period expires. During the time your tokens are controlled by the
applicable software system, you will lose all powers over and benefits with respect to such
tokens, other than the specific uses that such code allows you to make of such tokens during
the deposit period, if any. You may lose financial opportunities, or the value of your tokens
may decline during such deposit periods. Depending on the exact technology and functions
involved, even systems that normally allow immediate withdrawals can impose withdrawal
delays or have withdrawals become unavailable, whether as a result of "slashing events,”
 "liquidation events,” "illiquidity events”, "insolvency events,” "hacks,” "exploits,” or
otherwise—any such events may lead to partial or total financial loss of your tokens.

Risks of Samurai Illiquidity Events and Insolvency Events.
Samurai can become illiquid or insolvent.

Tax Risks.
Choosing to receive any $KTNA, $KTNA V2, $HNR or $xHNR —including $xHNR received can have adverse tax
consequences and result in financial losses net of taxes, depending on your circumstances and
tax jurisdiction. Engaging in liquidity mining or staking, or
participation in the Samurai Governance may have adverse tax consequences and
result in financial losses net of taxes, depending on your circumstances.

Risks of Samurai Research, Development, Deployment, Maintenance, Etc.
Risks of No Promised Efforts or Resources.
The Samurai Ecosystem is intended to be community-governed. After the public launch of Samurai,
none of the persons who created all or any part of the Samurai smart contract system should be
expected to have a material ongoing role in Samurai research, development or promotion. Certain
relevant parties may elect to undertake limited ministerial activities directly or indirectly
related to Samurai, such as maintaining availability of a Samurai web interface, but no promise,
guarantee or assurance of such ministerial efforts or any other efforts is being made, and any
such efforts which do occur may be abandoned at any time, with or without advanced notice.
There is no 'Samurai enterprise', 'Samurai company' or 'Samurai business'.
No person or entity has promised you, or assumed any obligation to you to exert or provide
financial or other support for, any efforts, capital or resources in connection with the Samurai
Protocol. No person or entity has promised you, or assumed any obligation to you to exert or
provide financial support for, any research, development, promotion, marketing, maintenance,
monitoring, or improvements relating to the Samurai Protocol. Any past, present or future efforts on the part of any
entity or person are being conducted on a voluntary and not committed basis, and are not
intended as, and must not be construed or relied upon as, a promise of continuing efforts.

Risks of Decentralized Governance.
Any smart contract parameter adjustments, approvals, or other changes required to the Samurai Protocol or any
instance thereof shall include approval of the Samurai governance, which consists of a dispersed
group of $xHNR token holders that may be unable or unwilling to sufficiently coordinate to
produce action.
